Arthritis,"Arthritis is inflammation of one or more of your joints. The main symptoms of arthritis are joint pain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age. The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis causes cartilage (the hard, slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they form a joint) to break down. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that first targets the lining of joints (synovium). Uric acid crystals, infections or underlying disease, such as psoriasis or lupus, can cause other types of arthritis. Treatments vary depending on the type of arthritis. The main goals of arthritis treatments are to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.

Symptoms
Pain
Stiffness
Swelling
Redness
Decreased range of motion

Treatments
Medications: The medications used to treat arthritis vary depending on the type of arthritis. Commonly used arthritis medications include analgestics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), counterirritants, disease-modifying antiheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologics and corticosteroids.

Therapy: Physical therapy can be helpful for some types of arthritis. Exercises can improve range of motion and strengthen the muscles surrounding joints. In some cases, splints or braces may be warranted.

Surgery: If conservative measures don't help, your doctor may suggest surgery such as joint replacement or joint fusion.",condition-arthritis.jpg,Cta 1,Arthritis and Rheumatology,
Physical Therapy,"Physical therapy is a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialty that remediates impairments and promotes mobility, function, and quality of life through examination, diagnosis, prognosis, and physical intervention (therapy using mechanical force and movements). It is carried out by physical therapists and physical therapist assistants.

Because the body of knowledge of physical therapy is large, physical therapists usually specialize in a specific clinical area. While there are many different types of physical therapy, the American Board of Physical Therapy Specialties list ten specialist certifications: cardiovascular & pulmonary physiotherapy, clinical electrophysiology, geriatric, integumentary, neurological, orthopedic, pediatric, sports, women's health, and palliative care.",condition-physical-therapy.jpg,Cta 1,Physical Therapy,
Cataracts,"A cataract is a clouding of the normally clear lens of your eye. For people who have cataracts, seeing through cloudy lenses is a bit like looking through a frosty or fogged-up window. Clouded vision caused by cataracts can make it more difficult to read, drive a car (especially at night) or see the expression on a friend's face. Most cataracts develop slowly and don't disturb your eyesight early on. But with time, cataracts will eventually interfere with your vision. At first, stronger lighting and eyeglasses can help you deal with cataracts. But if impaired vision interferes with your usual activities, you might need cataract surgery. Fortunately, cataract surgery is generally a safe, effective procedure.

Symptoms
Clouded, blurred or dim vision
Increasing difficulty with vision at night
Sensitivity to light and glare
Seeing ""halos"" around lights
Frequent challenges in eyeglass or contact lens prescription
Fading or yellowing of colors
Double vision in a single eye

Treatments
The only effective treatment for cataracts is surgery. Talk with your eye doctor about whether surgery is right for you. Most eye doctors suggest considering cataract surgery when your cataracts begin to affect your quality of life or interfere with you ability to perform normal daily activities.",condition-cataracts.jpg,Cta 1,Optometry,
Anemia,"Anemia is a condition that develops when your blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a main part of red blood cells that binds oxygen. If you have too few or abnormal red blood cells, or your hemoglobin is abnormal or low, the cells in your body will not get enough oxygen. Anemia is the most common blood condition in the U.S. There are many types of anemia, which all vary in causes and treatments.

Symptoms
Fatigue
Weakness
Pale skin
A fast or irregular heartbeat
Shortness of breath
Chest pain
Dizziness
Cognitive problems
Cold hands and feet
Headache

Treatments
Anemia treatment depends on the cause.

Iron deficiency anemia: This form of anemia is treated with changes in your diet and iron supplements. If the underlying cause of iron deficiency is loss of blood (other than from menstruation) the source of the bleeding must be located and stopped. This may involve surgery.

Vitamin deficiency anemias: Folic acid and vitamin C deficiency anemias are treated with dietary supplements and increasing these nutrients in your diet. If your digestive system has trouble absorbing vitamin B-12 from the food you eat, you may receive vitamin B-12 injections.

Anemia of chronic disease: There's no specific treatment for this type of anemia. Doctors focus on treating the underlying disease. If symptoms become severe, a blood transfusion or injections of synthetic erythropoietin, a hormone normally produced by your kidneys, may help stimulate red blood cell production and ease fatigue.

Aplastic anemia: Treatment for this anemia may include blood transfusions to boost levels of red blood cells. You may need a bone marrow transplant if your bone marrow is diseased and can't make healthy blood cells.

Anemias associated with bone marrow disease: Treatment of these various diseases can include simple medication, chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation.

Hemolytic anemias: Managing hemolytic anemias includes avoiding suspect medications, treating related infections and taking drugs that suppress your immune system, which may be attacking your red blood cells. Depending on the severity of your anemia, a blood transfusion or plasmapheresis may be necessary. Plasmapheresis is a type of blood-filtering procedure. In certain cases, removal of the spleen can be helpful.

Sickle cell anemia: Treatment for this anemia may include the administration of oxygen, pain-relieving drugs, and oral and intravenous fluids to reduce pain and prevent complications. Doctors also may recommend blood transfusions, folic acid supplements and antibiotics. A bone marrow transplant may be an effective treatment in some circumstances. A cancer drug called hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) also is used to treat sickle cell anemia.

Thalassemia. This anemia may be treated with blood transfusions, folic acid supplements, removal of the spleen (splenectomy), a bone marrow transplant or a another drug.",condition-anemia.jpg,Cta 1,Hematology,
Pancreatitis,"Pancreatitis is inflammation in the pancreas. The pancreas is a long, flat gland that sits tucked behind the stomach in the upper abdomen. The pancreas produces enzymes that assist digestion and hormones that help regulate the way your body processes sugar (glucose).

Pancreatitis can occur as acute pancreatitis, meaning it appears suddenly and lasts for days. Or pancreatitis can occur as chronic pancreatitis, which describes pancreatitis that occurs over many years.

Mild cases of pancreatitis may go away without treatment, but severe cases can cause life-threatening complications.",condition-pancreatitis.jpg,Cta 1,Gastroenterology & Hepatology,
Hyperhidrosis,"Hyperhidrosis is excessive sweating that occurs even when the temperature isn't hot and you're not exercising. In some people who have hyperhidrosis, the sweat literally drips off their hands.

Hyperhidrosis usually affects the palms of the hands, soles of the feet and underarms. Besides disrupting normal daily activities, hyperhidrosis can cause social anxiety or embarrassment.

One of the first options for treatment involves using prescription-strength antiperspirants on the affected areas. In severe cases, your doctor may suggest surgery either to remove the sweat glands or to disconnect the nerves responsible for the overproduction of sweat.",condition-hyperhidrosis.jpg,Cta 1,Dermatology,
Allergies,"Allergies occur when your immune system reacts to a foreign substance, such as pollen, bee venom, or pet dander, that doesn't cause a reaction in most people. 

Your immune system produces substances known as antibodies. Some antibodes protect you from unwanted invaders that could make you sick or cause infection. 

When you have allergies, your immune system makes antibodies that identify a particular allergen as harmful, even though it isn't. When you come into contact with the allergen, your immune system's reaction can inflame your skin, sinuses, airways, or digestive system. 

The severity of allergies varies from person to person and can range from minor irritation to potentially life-threatening emergency. While most allergies can't be cured, a number of treatments can help relieve your allergy symptoms. Allergy symptoms depend on the substance method and can involve the airwars, sinuses and nasal passages, skin, and digestive system.

Symptoms
Swelling
Sneezing
Itching
Coughing
Watery eyes
Runny, stuffy nose

Treatments
Allergen avoidance: Your doctor will help you take steps to identify and avoid your allergy triggers. This is generally the most important step in preventing allergic reactions and reducing symptoms.

Medications to reduce symptoms: Depending on your allergy, allergy medications can help reduce your immune system reaction and ease symptoms. Medications can include over-the-counter or prescription medications in the form of oral medications, nasal sprays or eyedrops.

Immunotherapy: For severe allergies or allergies not completely relieved by other treatment, your doctor may recommend allergen immunotherapy. This treatment involves a series of injections of purified allergen extracts, usually given over a period of a few years. Another form of immunotherapy is a tablet that's placed under the tongue (sublingual) until it dissolves. Sublingual drugs are used to treat some pollen allergies.

Emergency epinephrine: If you have a severe allergy, your doctor may give you an emergency epinephrine shot to carry with you at all times. Given for severe allergic reactions, an epinephrine shot (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others) can reduce symptoms until you get emergency treatment.",condition-allergies.jpg,Cta 1,Allergy & Immunology,
Narcolepsy,"Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep. People with narcolepsy often find it difficult to stay awake for long periods of time, regardless of the circumstances. Narcolepsy can cause serious disruptions in your daily routine.

Contrary to what some people believe, narcolepsy isn't related to depression, seizure disorders, fainting, simple lack of sleep or other conditions that may cause abnormal sleep patterns.

Narcolepsy is a chronic condition for which there's no cure. However, medications and lifestyle changes can help you manage the symptoms. Support fro family, friends, employers, or teachers can help you cope with narcolepsy.

Symptoms
Excessive daytime sleepiness: People with narcolepsy fall asleep without warning, anywhere, anytime. For example, you may suddenly nod off while working or talking with friends. You may sleep for a few minutes or up to a half-hour before awakening and feeling refreshed, but eventually you fall asleep again.

Sudden loss of muscle tone: This condition, called cataplexy, can cause a number of physical changes, from slurred speech to complete weakness of most muscles, and may last for a few seconds to a few minutes.

Sleep paralysis: People with narcolepsy often experience a temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking. These episodes are usually brief (lasting one or two minutes) but can be frightening. You may be aware of the condition and have no difficulty recalling it afterward, even if you had no control over what was happening to you.

Hallucinations: These hallucinations are called hypnagogic hallucinations if occurring as you fall asleep and hypnopompic hallucinations if occurring upon waking. Because you may be semi-awake when you begin dreaming, you experience your dreams as reality, and they may be particularly vivid and frightening.

Treatments
There is no cure for narcolepsy, but medications and lifestyle modifications can help you manage the symptoms.

Stimulant: Drugs that stimulate the central nervous system are the primary treatment to help people with narcolepsy stay awake during the day. Doctors often try modafinil (Provigil) or armodafinil (Nuvigil) first for narcolepsy because it isn't as addictive as older stimulants and doesn't produce the highs and lows often associated with older stimulants. Side effects of modafinil are uncommon, but they may include headache, nausea or dry mouth.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): Doctors often prescribe these medications, which suppress REM sleep, to help alleviate the symptoms of cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. They include fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem, others) and venlafaxine (Effexor XR). Side effects can include sexual dysfunction and digestive problems.

Tricyclic antidepressants: These older antidepressants, such as protriptyline (Vivactil), imipramine (Tofranil) and clomipramine (Anafranil), are effective for cataplexy, but many people complain of side effects, such as dry mouth and lightheadedness.

Sodium oxybate (Xyrem): This medication is highly effective for cataplexy. Sodium oxybate helps to improve nighttime sleep, which is often poor in narcolepsy. In high doses it may also help control daytime sleepiness. It must be taken in two doses, one at bedtime and one up to four hours later. Xyrem can have serious side effects, such as nausea, bed-wetting and worsening of sleepwalking. Taking sodium oxybate together with other sleeping medications, narcotic pain relievers or alcohol can lead to difficulty breathing, coma and death.",condition-narcolepsy.jpg,Cta 1,General Surgery,
Epilepsy,"Epilepsy is a central nervous system disorder (neurological disorder) in which nerve cell activity in the brain becomes disrupted, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations and sometimes loss of consciousness

Seizure symptoms can vary widely. Some people with epilepsy simply stare blankly for a few seconds during a seizure, while others repeatedly twitch their arms or legs.

About 1 in 26 people in the United States will develop a seizure disorder. Nearly 10 percent of individuals may have a single unprovoked seizure. However, a single seizure doesn't mean you have epilepsy. At least two unprovoked seizures are generally required for an epilepsy diagnosis.

Even mild seizures may require treatment because they can be dangerous during activities such as driving or swimming. Treatment with medications or sometimes surgery can control seizures for about 80 percent of people with epilepsy. Some children with epilepsy may also outgrow their condition with age.

Symptoms
Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in brain cells, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include:

Temporary confusion
A staring spell
Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs
Loss of consciousness or awareness
Psychic symptoms

Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode.

Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins.

Treatments
Medication: Most people with epilepsy can become seizure-free by taking one anti-seizure medication, called anti-epileptic medication. Others may be able to decrease the frequency and intensity of their seizures by taking a combination of medications. Your doctor will advise you about the appropriate time to stop taking medications.

Surgery: Surgery is most commonly done when tests show that your seizures originate in a small, well-defined area of your brain that doesn't interfere with vital functions such as speech, language, motor function, vision or hearing. In surgery, your doctor removes the area of your brain that's causing the seizures.

Therapies: This includes vagus nerve stimulation and a ketogenic diet.",condition-epilepsy.jpg,Cta 1,General Surgery,
