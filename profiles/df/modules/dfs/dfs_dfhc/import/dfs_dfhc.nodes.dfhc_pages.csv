"Visitor Guidelines","    We know that a healing environment for our patients involves the loving support of family and friends. That's why we strive to allow guests flexible options for their visits. We invite guests to visit in accordance with each patient's wishes.


    We ask that visitors be courteous to other patients by keeping noise at a reasonable level while in the facility. Please keep in mind that all children under age must be supervised by an adult while in the facility. Additionally, if you or your children are experiencing any symptoms, such as sore throat, fever or cough, please plan to forego your visit.


    Other visiting restrictions may be enacted at varying times throughout the year, such as during influenza season. Often, room sizes may not allow for large group visits or other circumstances may reduce visiting hours. Please check with the individual unit for current visitation rules.",famguide2-sqr.jpg,famguide1-wide.jpg,"Help us keep Baypoint a safe, inviting place by following these guidelines.",Guidelines,"5005,5007,5006","Family & Visitor Guidelines",family-visitor,menu-footer-menu-2,2,5004,"Learn More"

"Identification Badges","    To protect the security and privacy of our patients, all visitors must check in with a Guest Services Representative at the Information Desk in the Main Lobby to obtain a Visitor Badge. A brief health screening will be conducted at the time of check-in.

    Badges must be worn at all times while visiting in the hospital. Adults who accompany children to Same Day Surgery receive their ID badges in that area. All guests under 18 years of age must be accompanied by an adult and are screened for infectious disease.

    Badges are issued at the Welcome/Information Center, Floor 1A, from 7 a.m. 10:30 p.m. daily, or in the Admitting office, Floor 1b. Off-hours badging services are available at the patient access desk in the Emergency Department.

 •  Yellow badges indicate individuals who wish to visit the Family Resource Center or who need to go to an outpatient service on Floor 6, 7 or 9. Patients and families arriving to Floor 4 for a surgery or procedure receive a printed yellow badge at the registration desk.

 •  Pink badges are for families and guests to inpatient units on Floors 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, along with a swipe card for access. Visitors must provide a confidentiality code to receive a pink badge.

 •  White badges are given to visitors to the Emergency Department. They are valid in the ED and open access areas from Floors 1-3.

    Any visitor to the hospital or patient guest on the patient units or other area accessed by the orange elevators without an identification badge will be directed to the Welcome/Information Center to be properly identified and badged. Public Safety will be contacted if a guest is unwilling or unable to comply with this procedure.

Badges expire after 24 hours. Family members with children in an inpatient care unit are eligible to receive a one-week badge.",visitor-passes-sqr.jpg,famguide1-wide.jpg,"We use identification badges to protect your security and privacy.",Identification,"5004,5021,5007","Identification Badges",id-badges,menu-footer-menu-2,6,5006,"Learn More"
