Getting Through My Cancer Treatment,"<p>My care team has gone out of its way to provide the best care possible. My doctors took whatever time was needed to answer questions my family and I had about my treatment and recovery. After surgery, my treatment has consisted of chemotherapy and radiation. I took Xeloda at first, and now I am taking a combination of Xeloda and oxaliplatin. The medications cause fatigue and sensitivity to cold. My care team at CTCA prepared me for these side effects. They took away my gelato when I first started treatment because they knew it would be painful for me to eat something that cold. The sensitivity lasts for a week or two after each treatment. Other side effects have also been addressed by my care team. My naturopathic clinician and dietitian recommended B complex, glutamine, L-glutamine, supplementing my food intake with a protein shake, and making sure to eat fruits that would help keep my energy levels up, like bananas and berries. I was one of the first patients to be treated at Baypoint Medical Center. It was really helpful to have the surgeon and radiation oncologist in the room at the same time discussing my treatment. The team has gone out of its way to provide the best care possible. The radiation team stayed late when I needed it, and everyone arranged their schedule around mine. My doctors took whatever time was needed to answer whatever questions Keisha and I had about my treatment and recovery. With this support, and the support and amazing care that Keisha has given me, I have been able to continue working. No one at my workplace even knew I had cancer while I was going through chemotherapy and radiation. When I was about to undergo surgery, I let my coworkers know. They were so inspired by my ability to continue working while I was coping with treatment.</p>","Research,Employee",story1-sqr.jpg,Gastroenterology & Hepatology,Condition 1,Dr. John Tesla MD,Cta 1,Location 2,,1
